As part of my role as a contributor to [Boring Security](https://boringsecurity.com), I was often asked how communities can protect themselvesto stay safe in web3. Some of the most common issues were Discord settings, permissions, and how moderation worked at the server level.

I wrote this article to help people understand how to secure their Discord servers and keep their communities safe from scammers, spammers, and other bad actors.
