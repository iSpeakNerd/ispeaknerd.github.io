# Work Sample 4: User Options Flowchart

**Project:** POAP Distribution Methods

**Context:** As a community member and POAP creator, I was very confused by the overwhelming amount of options for delivering POAPs to users. But there was no documentation at the time, Fall 2022, giving cross-option considerations, all the docs were focused on method → use but as a user I found myself confused and lost because I had the use but was struggling to choose the proper method. I created this flowchart to focus on the user perspective.

**Achievements:** I learned to think about inverting the engineering mindset of `method → use` and made this to focus on the user perspective of `uses → method`.
