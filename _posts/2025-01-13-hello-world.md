# First Post

Hello World!
Oooh boy, it's taken a bit to get here. 

I realized while applying for new roles last year that I didn't have a singular online presence for my portfolio. This site is the result of me remedying that.

I'm an educator by training, and techie by passion. I've taught high school math, blockchain courses, and more recently, I've been teaching myself to code TypeScript in 2024. 

I have experience technical writing, educational content creation, and developer support in web3. I'm skilled at creating accessible documentation, engaging tutorials, and learning resources to demystify complex topics.

Super active on Farcaster, big fan of the folks I've met there.
